  "course_description": "This three-module sequence of courses covers advanced topics in quantum computation and quantum information, including quantum error correction code techniques; efficient quantum computation principles, including fault-tolerance; and quantum complexity theory and quantum information theory. Prior knowledge of quantum circuits and elementary quantum algorithms is assumed. These courses are the second part in a sequence of two quantum information science subjects at MIT.\n\nThe three modules comprise:\n\n[8.371.1x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.1x+1T2018/about): Quantum states, noise and error correction  \n[8.371.2x](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.2x+1T2018/about): Efficient quantum computing\u2014fault tolerance and algorithms  \n[8.371.3x](http://: https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+8.370.3x+1T2018/about): Quantum complexity theory and information theory\n\nThis course was organized as a three-part series on [MITx](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx) by MIT\u2019s Department of Physics and is now archived on the [Open Learning Library](https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/open-learning-library), which is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in each module if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials without enrolling.\n",
